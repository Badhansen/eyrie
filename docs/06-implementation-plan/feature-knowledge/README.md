# 06·K — Architecture Knowledge Loop

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Product | Eyrie |
| Owner | Badhan Sen |
| Status | **Partly built.** The System lens and a review prototype (`pnpm arch`) exist. The loop itself — policies, findings in the product, adaptation, AI explanations — is proposed |
| Last updated | 2026-10-14 |
| Answers | How does Eyrie keep an architecture honest while the code changes, and show a developer what matters? |
| Replaces | The original AI-features proposal (a PDF, kept with the research material outside this repository), its review, and a separate build plan — all folded in here |
| Related | [PRD](../../01-product-requirements/README.md) · [TRD](../../02-technical-requirements/README.md) · [Backend Schema](../../05-backend-schema/README.md) · [Implementation Plan](../README.md) · [PRODUCT.md](../../../PRODUCT.md) · [`pnpm arch`](../../../scripts/arch-review/README.md) |

## 1. Summary

The original proposal asked for three AI features: component summaries, an impact-analysis chat and an architecture review agent. Checked against the code and the research, the stronger version is a **feedback-adaptive architecture watcher**:

1. Eyrie already keeps a live model of the code.
2. The team states the **intended** architecture as explicit rules in a small file in the repository.
3. After every save, deterministic checks compare the two and record **findings**, with exact evidence.
4. Optional AI explains findings from that evidence. It never decides what counts as a violation.
5. A person confirms, fixes, or marks a finding as an intended exception. An exception becomes a narrow, reviewed policy change that cannot hide a known violation.

What improves over time is the relevance of the guidance, at preserved detection. The code improves when a person acts on it.

## 2. What is built

| Piece | Where | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **System lens** — the whiteboard view: one box per app or package and per layer, external services and missing routes as their own boxes, labelled links. Key `4` | [`packages/lens/src/system.ts`](../../../packages/lens/src/system.ts), web app | Shipped |
| **Review prototype** — 13 deterministic checks, a durable SQLite store (`.eyrie/knowledge.db`) with finding history, and a protocol for people and AI agents to add issues, proposals and reviews with `path:line` evidence. Triage and decisions are human-only | [`scripts/arch-review/`](../../../scripts/arch-review/README.md) | Developer tool, outside the product packages |
| **Route scoping fix** — a relative `fetch('/api/…')` inside one Next.js app no longer links to a sibling app's route | `packages/graph/src/code-graph.ts` (`matchRoute`) | Shipped, with a regression test |

**First self-review of Eyrie** (`pnpm arch scan` at `3cfaad8`): no package or file cycles; nothing reachable from the browser bundle imports a Node built-in; 4 warnings and 38 informational findings. The ones that matter for this feature:

- Import edges between two files are merged into one, keeping only the first statement's line and type-only flag, so a later runtime import can be hidden. **Open.**
- Trace and impact exist only in the browser; the engine cannot answer "what does this affect". Prerequisite for build step 7.
- Change history lives only in browser memory (last 240 batches).
- `@eyrie/core` and `@eyrie/storage` have no tests of their own; storage holds the cache-invalidation logic.

The full record lives in the local database; `pnpm arch report` regenerates it.

## 3. What "improvement" means

It does **not** mean an agent that rewrites the codebase. That is code authoring, it contradicts "Eyrie reads; your editor writes" in [PRODUCT.md](../../../PRODUCT.md), and the self-improving-agent research that does it depends on sandboxes and benchmark-validated changes.

It **does** mean one testable property: **more relevant guidance without losing real violations.**

| Measure | How |
| --- | --- |
| Relevance | Findings judged relevant ÷ findings shown |
| Detection | Recall against independently labelled violations, including seeded ones |
| The failure that matters | A labelled true violation hidden by a policy change. Counted as a miss, never as noise reduction |
| Repair vs. suppression | Reported separately. Relaxing a rule is not fixing the code |
| Effort | Verdicts and approvals per accepted policy change |

## 4. Research base and prior art

| Work | What we take |
| --- | --- |
| Murphy, Notkin, Sullivan — *Software Reflexion Models*, IEEE TSE 2001 | The comparison of an intended model with extracted dependencies: convergences, divergences, absences |
| Koschke, Simon — *Hierarchical Reflexion Models*, WCRE 2003; Knodel, Popescu — WICSA 2007 | Nested components; how reflexion compares with rule-based conformance checking |
| Terra, Valente — *Dependency Constraint Language*, SPE 2009 | The rule forms in §6: *cannot*, *can only*, *only … can*, *must* |
| Buckley et al. — *JITTAC*, ICSE 2013 | Real-time reflexion in the IDE: continuous checking is prior art |
| ArchUnit freezing rules; dependency-cruiser `--baseline`; Nx module boundaries | Baselines and JS/TS dependency rules are prior art; exceptions are edited by hand, with no view of what else they hide |
| Sadowski et al. — *Tricorder*, ICSE 2015 | Developer feedback tunes analysis. Here feedback tunes a project's **policy**, not the analyzer |
| Kephart, Chess 2003; Blair et al. — *Models@run.time* 2009; Li et al. — *GenAI for Self-Adaptive Systems*, TAAS 2024 | The loop shape (monitor, analyse, plan, execute, knowledge), a live model, and a person on the loop |
| Fontana et al. — *Arcan*, 2017 | Smells with data-driven thresholds |
| Jansen, Bosch — WICSA 2005; Dhar et al. — ICSA 2024 | Decisions as records; LLM-drafted decisions need review |
| Li, Liang, Avgeriou, Wang — arXiv 2023–2026 | Showing detected violation symptoms raised developers' detection from 25.9% to 64.7% |
| De Luca et al. — *CIAO*, ICSA 2026; Zhang et al. — *SemRef*, 2026; Keim, Kaplan — ICSE-Companion 2026 | Structure from analysis, prose from models; automated architectural knowledge management |
| Archify | A readable high-level diagram; Eyrie's System lens derives the same level from code instead of authoring it |

**Positioning.** Checking, baselines and real-time reflexion exist. What is new here is the **adaptation protocol** (§8) and its evaluation: turning one adjudicated finding into the narrowest policy change, showing its collateral, and refusing changes that hide known violations.

## 5. The loop

                                 the approved policy version
```

**Hard rules**, inherited from the Phase 5 gate in [docs/06](../README.md):

1. **Findings are deterministic.** Only checks create findings. AI explains and may draft wording; it never creates a finding, an edge or a rule.
2. **AI off is a complete product.** A budget limit defers explanations, never findings.
3. **Unknown is not conformance.** Where resolution coverage is incomplete for a rule, its status is `unknown`.
4. **Nothing writes to user source.** Accepted policy is stored as versions; whether it is also written to `.eyrie/` in the repository is open decision 2.

## 6. Policy: the intended architecture

### 6.1 File

Explicit rules, versioned with the code and reviewed in pull requests. The grammar is illustrative:

```yaml
# .eyrie/architecture.yml
version: 1
modules:
  orders:   { paths: ["src/app/orders/**", "src/services/order*"] }
  payments: { paths: ["src/services/*payment*"] }

rules:
  - id: payments-through-gateway
    cannot: { from: { module: orders }, to: { external: Stripe } }
    because: ADR-0007
  - id: ui-reads-through-api
    cannot: { from: { lane: ui }, to: { lane: data } }
    except:
      - { from: { kind: page, serverOnly: true }, because: ADR-0003 }
  - id: orders-use-payments
    must: { from: { module: orders }, to: { module: payments } }
```

### 6.2 Semantics

| Form | Meaning | Finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cannot(X, Y)` | Nothing matching X depends on Y | Divergence, per offending link |
| `only(X, Y)` | X depends only on Y | Divergence, per offending link |
| `only-from(X, Y)` | Only X may depend on Y | Divergence, per offending link |
| `must(X, Y)` | Every X depends on some Y | Absence — only when coverage for X is complete, otherwise `unknown` |

- **Selectors:** module (path globs), lane, kind, single component, fact predicates such as `serverOnly`. **Dependency kinds** are explicit per rule (import, call, HTTP, read/write). **Direct** dependencies only, at first.
- **Unmapped files** are a coverage gap, never a violation. **Overlapping modules** are rejected when the policy loads.
- **Exceptions narrow exactly one rule** (`rule ∧ ¬scope`), carry a reason and decision link, and may expire; on expiry the affected findings return as `reopened`. They cannot widen another rule, so precedence is never ambiguous.

### 6.3 Starting without noise

On the ~290-file smoke repository (`next-prisma-tailwind-ecommerce` at `3f21c75`, Eyrie at `3cfaad8`, counted mechanically), naive rules would report **26** "UI reads the data layer" findings — all Next.js server pages — and **61** components with no callers, **43** of them entry points. So:

- **Baseline** what fails on day one, as ArchUnit and dependency-cruiser do. Baselining changes presentation, never the truth of a finding.
- **Inferred rules are suggestions, labelled as observations of today's code**, and need an owner's confirmation. Accepting the current graph wholesale would normalise existing erosion.

## 7. Findings

A finding is identified by `hash(rule id, form, subject identities)` — never by line numbers or evidence — so it keeps its identity across edits and restarts. Four attributes stay independent:

| Attribute | Values |
| --- | --- |
| Observation | `present`, `absent`, `unknown` |
| Triage | `untriaged`, `confirmed`, `intended`, `mapping-wrong`, `detector-wrong` |
| Baseline | member or not |
| Lifecycle | append-only events: `observed`, `resolved-by-source`, `suppressed-by-policy(v)`, `reopened`, `retired-by-check-change` |

Every record carries project, checkout and snapshot identity, analyzer version and policy version. A dismissal never deletes a finding; a suppression is never a repair; a finding that disappears because the check logic changed is *retired*, not *resolved*. Hubs and apparently unreferenced code are review candidates, not violations: framework conventions and dynamic loading produce those shapes legitimately.

## 8. Adaptation protocol

Only one kind of feedback relaxes policy:

| Verdict | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `confirmed` | Stays; may be linked to a decision |
| `intended` | Generates a candidate exception |
| `mapping-wrong` | Proposes a mapping edit, reviewed separately |
| `detector-wrong` | Records an analyzer defect; never handled by policy |

1. Pin the finding, its evidence, the policy and decision versions.
2. Record the verdict and a reason. No reason, no generalised exception.
3. **Generate the narrowest candidate.** For a witness `a → b` under rule `r`, candidates widen in steps: L0 the exact files; L1 the two components; L2 a fact predicate shared by the selected sources, intersected with the rule's selector (e.g. `kind = page ∧ serverOnly`); L3 the two modules. Never above L3, never "disable the rule". A model may phrase the rationale; it does not choose the level.
4. **Preview the collateral**: every currently present finding the candidate would also suppress, each to be acknowledged or the candidate narrowed.
5. **Gate it** on a locked regression set of labelled findings: reject if it suppresses any true violation. The set grows with every `confirmed` verdict and with seeded violations, and is never used to generate candidates.
6. **An owner approves**; a new policy version activates with reason, scope, gate report and optional expiry.
7. **Roll back** to the predecessor if a later confirmed violation was hidden.

On the smoke repository, an L2 candidate `kind = page ∧ serverOnly` covers the 26 UI-reads-data findings with empty collateral, and the rule keeps reporting any other UI component that reads the data layer.

## 9. Roles

One runner, one queue; roles coordinate through the database rather than by talking to each other.

| Role | Kind | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Change classifier | Deterministic | Marks what in a batch is architecturally significant |
| Policy checker | Deterministic | Evaluates §6 rules |
| Smell checks | Deterministic | Cycles (strongly connected components), data-driven hubs, unreferenced code from code-level imports, missing routes |
| Explainer | AI, optional | Explains a finding from its evidence and linked decisions — the **only AI role in the first prototype** |
| Later | AI, optional | Summaries for thin components, decision drafting (always needs acceptance), digests, Q&A over deterministic queries |

A finding can produce a **hand-off brief** (evidence, decision, impact) for the developer's own coding agent. Eyrie never runs a write-capable agent.

## 10. AI integration

**Backends**, behind one interface (`run({ prompt, schema, timeoutMs, signal }) → { json, usage }`): an HTTP API (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, Ollama) first, because it is tool-free; then Claude Code (`claude -p … --output-format json`), Codex (`codex exec`, read-only by default) and Antigravity (`agy -p … --json-schema`), each verified per version at build time. Antigravity's headless mode allows writing files in its working folder, and an open issue reports `agy -p` hanging without a TTY.

**Isolation.** A scratch working directory is not a sandbox: a process can still use absolute paths or spawn others. CLI backends run only with OS-enforced read-only or sandbox modes, and are tested for outside writes, absolute-path reads, subprocesses, cancellation and instructions hidden in repository text. Repository text is data in prompts, never instructions.

**Inference gate**, in order: a template answer from the evidence (zero tokens) → a cached explanation whose full dependency manifest is unchanged (zero new tokens) → one bounded call, when requested or for a significant finding after a quiet period → deferral, with evidence still shown. Mandatory evidence (the witness, the rule, the decision's scope and version) is never truncated; if it does not fit, the explanation waits. Agent CLIs add a large fixed overhead per call — Antigravity's own documentation shows about 10k input tokens for a one-sentence answer — so their usage is reported separately from the evidence budget.

**Validation.** Schema-valid; factual claims cite evidence IDs; names and numbers match the packet; advice is labelled as advice; a result is published only if its inputs did not change since it was requested.

**Privacy.** Off by default and per project; the UI names the backend and model wherever AI output appears; packets hold names, paths, signatures, doc comments and graph relationships, not whole files. Shipping any backend requires rewording the README privacy section and the PRD scope, and a pass through [docs/05 §10](../../05-backend-schema/README.md).

## 11. Storage and identity

| Store | Lifetime | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `graph.db` (exists) | **Disposable cache**; a `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump drops it | Parse facts, code graph |
| `knowledge.db` | **Durable**; versioned migrations that only add | Runs, findings and their observations and events, feedback, policy versions, decisions, explanations, jobs, trends |
| `.eyrie/` in the repo | Versioned with the code | Policy file, accepted decisions, baseline (open decision 1) |

The prototype's store ([`scripts/arch-review/db.ts`](../../../scripts/arch-review/db.ts)) already implements runs, fingerprinted findings with per-run observations, append-only events, issues, proposals, reviews and decisions, with observation and triage kept separate. Moving it into a `@eyrie/knowledge` package is the first build step.

**Identity.** A logical project id (explicit, local) plus a checkout id, so concurrent checkouts never share mutable state; a snapshot id from a content manifest, because a commit hash does not identify an uncommitted working tree. A git root commit is not enough: forks share it and shallow clones may lack it. Entities keep immutable ids with versioned path aliases; a rename inferred from identical content applies going forward, ambiguous moves go to a person, and historical evidence keeps the path it was observed at.

**Retention.** Change history 30 days; finished jobs 7 days; superseded explanations pruned to three per target. Deleting the project's data folder removes everything. No telemetry.

**External memory** ([TencentDB Agent Memory](https://github.com/TencentCloud/TencentDB-Agent-Memory)) is an optional sink and source, never a requirement: export accepted decisions and per-module architecture pages; import decisions as *proposed*. Its own code graph is not used — Eyrie's graph stays the only structural source of truth — and its agent proxy is never required.

## 12. Desktop app (Phase D)

An Electron app ([`apps/desktop`](../../../apps/desktop/README.md), built with Electron Forge) running the engine in a utility process per watched project (loopback, random port, per-run token, as today), watching in the background from the tray. Notifications are off by default and, when on, limited to new, non-baseline, warning-or-worse findings after a quiet period. GUI apps on macOS get a minimal `PATH`, so the login shell's `PATH` is read once (the first version does this) and explicit binary paths are allowed. API keys live in the OS keychain only. `node:sqlite` needs Node 22.13+; Electron 44 runs Node 24, so no separate Node ships with the app. A signed binary is gated by the AGPL-3.0 / `elkjs` licensing review in [docs/06 §5](../README.md).

## 13. UI surfaces

- **System lens** (shipped): boxes by app or package and layer, labelled links, a details panel listing what each box holds with a way down to every component; search, marks and the change tape roll up to boxes. **Next:** nested group boundaries drawn as boxes around boxes, expanding a box in place, and the written overlay (names, owners, link labels) checked against the code.
- **Findings** (planned): a panel, new first, with evidence, explanation and actions (*Confirm*, *Intended — with reason*, *Mapping wrong*, *Detector wrong*, *Hand off*); badges on components and boxes that are part of their accessible name; divergences drawn with a dash pattern **and** a glyph, never colour alone; markers on the change tape where findings appear or resolve; a loop-health view (relevance, suppressed violations, explanation rejection rate).

## 14. Today and needed

| Need | Today | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live model of the code | ✅ Incremental graph and diffs | Import-edge merging hides later runtime imports (§2) |
| High-level view | ✅ System lens | Nested boundaries, expand in place, written overlay |
| Deterministic checks | ✅ 13 checks in the prototype | Policy checker for §6 rules |
| Durable findings with history | ✅ Prototype store | Move into the product as `@eyrie/knowledge`; project/checkout identity |
| Trace and impact | ✅ Browser only | Shared package used by engine and UI |
| Change history | Browser memory, 240 batches | Server-side record |
| Feedback, adaptation | Prototype records triage and decisions | Candidate generation, preview, gate, versioned policy |
| AI explanations | — | Gate, one tool-free adapter, validation |
| Desktop shell | First version: one window, one project, engine in a utility process; packages on macOS | Tray, background watching, several projects, signing |

## 15. Build order

Each step has a completion condition, as in [docs/06](../README.md).

| Step | Deliverable | Done when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Durable findings and history** in the product: `@eyrie/knowledge` with migrations, project/checkout/snapshot identity; the existing missing-route signal as the first finding kind; read-only, token-protected findings endpoints; a basic findings list | A missing-route finding survives restart, resolves when the handler is added, reopens when it is removed — with one identity throughout; unknown coverage never resolves a finding; two checkouts do not share state |
| 2 | **Explicit constraints**: one `cannot` rule between explicitly mapped modules | The rule produces a finding with source evidence and policy version; removing the dependency resolves it |
| 3 | **Findings panel and baseline** | Evidence opens the source; baseline, lifecycle and verdict are separate and existing problems stay inspectable |
| 4 | **Feedback and linked decisions** | Verdicts and reasons persist; accepted decision versions link to components; dismissal never implies resolution |
| 5 | **Scoped exception proposals** (§8) | An `intended` finding produces a narrow template candidate; the preview lists collateral; the gate and approval precede activation; rollback restores the previous version |
| 6 | **Replay and measurement** | Fixed and adaptive policies run over identical pinned snapshots; reports separate repairs, suppressions, relevance, recall and effort |
| 7 | **Inference gate and cached explanations** | Templates and valid caches avoid calls; mandatory evidence is kept whole; full-request accounting and freshness checks work before any model is called |
| 8 | **One optional explainer** | AI off stays complete; failures leave evidence visible; unsupported claims are rejected; total usage includes retries |

**First demonstration** (the milestone that proves the loop): a pinned fixture with an Orders-to-provider `cannot` rule → introduce the import and see the finding with evidence → restart and see the history → record a justified migration exception and preview its scope → approve it and confirm a prohibited import elsewhere is still reported → roll back and see the original finding return.

**Deferred** until the loop works: the desktop shell, several AI backends, digests, broad Q&A, external memory. They widen the product without testing whether adaptation helps.

## 16. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Noisy first run switches the loop off | Explicit rules, baseline, inferred rules only as suggestions (§6.3) |
| Adaptation hides real violations | Narrowest candidate, collateral preview, regression gate, rollback (§8) |
| AI states what the graph cannot know | Findings deterministic; evidence IDs; claims about runtime order or values out of scope |
| An agent CLI writes into the repository | Tool-free adapter first; CLIs only under OS-enforced read-only modes, tested |
| Knowledge from one branch or checkout leaks into another | Project, checkout and snapshot identity on every record (§11) |
| Renames orphan history | Immutable ids with path aliases; ambiguous moves reviewed |
| Scope creep into code review | Findings stay structural: dependencies, layers, cycles, coupling |
| Privacy claims drift | Off by default; README, PRD and docs/05 §10 updated in the same change that ships a backend |

## 17. Open decisions

1. **Where policy, decisions and baseline live**: in the repository under `.eyrie/` (shared, per branch, reviewed in PRs) or only on the machine. Eyrie's own `.gitignore` ignores `.eyrie/` today.
2. **May Eyrie write `.eyrie/*` on an explicit Accept?** A narrow exception to "Eyrie reads; your editor writes" — or Eyrie shows the content and the developer saves it.
3. **First AI backend and default state.** Recommended: a tool-free HTTP adapter first; AI off by default.
4. **Desktop notifications**: on, off, or off by default.
5. **Distribution**: does the desktop app become primary (blocking decision 4 in [docs/06](../README.md))?
